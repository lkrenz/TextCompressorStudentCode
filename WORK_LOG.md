| April 5    |       9-10pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 2 | 30 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                             I spent this time working with my group to come up with a solution to this problem. We spent most of the time trying to figure out a way to use codes for words to save on space, but I think I will begin to solve this problem using the binary tree solution. |
| December 4 |      9:25-9:55      | In this time, I finished fleshing out my solution and started to code it. I finished coding the node class and most of the binary tree class, but I didn't have enough time to finish the build sequence method. I also need to figure out a good way to include the binary tree in the meta data of the file, I'll work on this once I finish coding the rest of the data storage solution. |
