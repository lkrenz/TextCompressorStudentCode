| April 5     |       9-10pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 2  | 30 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                             I spent this time working with my group to come up with a solution to this problem. We spent most of the time trying to figure out a way to use codes for words to save on space, but I think I will begin to solve this problem using the binary tree solution. |
| December 4  |      9:25-9:55      | In this time, I finished fleshing out my solution and started to code it. I finished coding the node class and most of the binary tree class, but I didn't have enough time to finish the build sequence method. I also need to figure out a good way to include the binary tree in the meta data of the file, I'll work on this once I finish coding the rest of the data storage solution. |
| December 4  |     12:35-1:18      |                                                                                                                                                             I spent this time working to finish build sequence and to start coding the larger compress method. I ran into some issues with static notation but I got a lot done and will continue working on my solution in my next session. |
| December 4  |     1:18 - 1:45     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I almost finnished, I switched the way compress tree and compress node worked to directly utilize BinaryStdOut and started to code the expand method. |
| December 4  |      3:00-3:45      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I spent this time finishing off methods and solving an issue with the static naming of methods. My code is now ready to run but I have yet to run it. |
| December 4  |      3:50-3:55      |                                                                             The code does not work. I'm running into an error where the current node can be null which shouldn't happen as a null node should never be visited. It could be an issue with the declaration of the new nodes or an issue with the declaration of new BinaryTrees not instantly fully instantiating a new node. |
| December 9  |     11:25-11:55     |                                                                                                                                                                                       I used this time to think through a code implementation of the algorithm and to begin coding. Through this time I began to code compress and now fully understand the implementation of the TST class. |

I also need to add a check for EOF and add the delete char in. |
